            <div>
              <p>
                I’m Olga, an illustrator based in Athens, Greece. I began
                drawing a few years ago and somehow never stopped — as if a
                small door opened and refused to close. I create playful,
                colorful worlds inhabited by curious creatures with strong
                personalities and quiet attitudes. My work drifts toward the
                dreamy, always searching for the beauty, kindness, and light
                hidden in ordinary things.
              </p>

            <!-- Inspiration -->

              <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-xl text-primary mb-3">
                Inspiration
              </h2>
              <p>
                Nature, animals, and hidden beauty are constant sources of
                inspiration for me. I’m endlessly in awe of life, especially the
                small moments where joy fully lives. I often draw in the subway,
                in cafés, or even during long work meetings!
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Process -->
            <div>
              <h2 class="font-heading font-semibold text-xl text-primary mb-3">
                Process
              </h2>
              <p>
                Everything begins on paper. I start with pencil, letting the
                lines find their way, then move to ink to give them clarity and
                presence. Watercolor is my favorite medium — I’m drawn to its
                transparency and movement — though I enjoy experimenting and
                drawing with whatever feels right for the moment.

              <p>
                I'm open to collaborations, illustration projects, and creative
                partnerships. Whether it's editorial, merchandise, or something
                entirely new — I'd love to hear your idea.
